## 🏗️ MILESTONE 1 — Infrastructure Setup

---

### `#I-01` — Monorepo Setup with pnpm Workspaces + Test Suites

**Labels:** `infra` `testing` `devops`
**Milestone:** Milestone 1 — Infra
**Priority:** 🔴 Critical (blocks everything else)
**Estimated Time:** 2 days

#### Context
The GymFuel project is a monorepo containing 4 workspaces: `apps/user`, `apps/admin`, `apps/landing`, and `server`. Currently there is no unified package manager config, no shared TypeScript base config, and no test runners configured. This issue sets up the entire foundation so all future development has consistent tooling, linting, and testing from Day 1.

#### Scope of Work
- Initialize `pnpm-workspace.yaml` at root
- Create root `package.json` with workspace scripts (`test:all`, `lint:all`, `typecheck:all`, `dev:all`)
- Create `tsconfig.base.json` at root (extended by each app)
- Configure **ESLint** (with TypeScript + React rules) shared config
- Configure **Prettier** at root
- Set up **Vitest** in each of the 3 React apps (`apps/user`, `apps/admin`, `apps/landing`)
- Set up **Jest + Supertest** in `server/`
- Write 3 sample tests per workspace (to validate setup)
- Add test scripts to each `package.json`

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `pnpm install` from root installs all workspace dependencies
- [ ] `pnpm run test:all` runs all tests across all 4 workspaces
- [ ] `pnpm run lint:all` lints all workspaces with zero errors on fresh setup
- [ ] `pnpm run typecheck:all` runs `tsc --noEmit` across all workspaces with no errors
- [ ] Each workspace has at least 3 passing sample tests
- [ ] `tsconfig.base.json` is extended by all workspace `tsconfig.json` files

#### Test Criteria
| Type | Test | Expected |
|------|------|----------|
| Unit | `apps/user` — renders `<App />` without crashing | ✅ Pass |
| Unit | `apps/admin` — renders `<App />` without crashing | ✅ Pass |
| Unit | `apps/landing` — renders `<App />` without crashing | ✅ Pass |
| Unit | `server/` — health check handler returns `{ status: 'ok' }` | ✅ Pass |
| Integration | `server/` — `GET /api/system/health` returns `200 OK` | ✅ Pass |

#### Definition of Done
- [ ] All tests pass: `pnpm run test:all`
- [ ] No TypeScript errors: `pnpm run typecheck:all`
- [ ] No lint errors: `pnpm run lint:all`
- [ ] PR reviewed and merged to `main`

### `#I-02` — GitHub Actions CI Pipeline

**Labels:** `infra` `devops` `testing`
**Milestone:** Milestone 1 — Infra
**Priority:** 🔴 Critical
**Estimated Time:** 1–2 days
**Depends on:** `#I-01`

#### Context
Every pull request to `main` must automatically run lint, type-check, and tests to prevent broken code from being merged. This issue sets up the GitHub Actions CI workflow that runs on every `push` and `pull_request` targeting `main`. It also sets up job separation per workspace so failures are traceable.

#### Scope of Work
- Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Jobs (run in parallel where possible):
  - `lint` — runs ESLint across all workspaces
  - `typecheck` — runs `tsc --noEmit` across all workspaces
  - `test-user` — Vitest for `apps/user`
  - `test-admin` — Vitest for `apps/admin`
  - `test-landing` — Vitest for `apps/landing`
  - `test-server` — Jest for `server/`
- Add Node.js 24 + pnpm caching to speed up runs
- Add status badge to `README.md`

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CI runs automatically on every `push` and `pull_request` to `main`
- [ ] All 6 jobs appear separately in GitHub Actions UI
- [ ] A failing test causes the CI check to fail (blocks merge)
- [ ] A passing run shows all green checks
- [ ] pnpm cache reduces subsequent run times by >50%
- [ ] README has a CI status badge

#### Test Criteria
| Scenario | Expected Result |
|----------|----------------|
| Push with all tests passing | ✅ All CI jobs green |
| Push with a broken TypeScript type | ❌ `typecheck` job fails |
| Push with a failing unit test | ❌ Corresponding test job fails |
| PR opened with lint error | ❌ `lint` job fails, PR blocked |

#### Definition of Done
- [ ] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` committed and working
- [ ] All jobs verified green on a clean push
- [ ] Deliberately broken test confirmed to fail CI
- [ ] README badge updated
